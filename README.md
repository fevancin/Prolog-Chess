# Chess with Prolog!

A simple chess application to play a game against a Prolog AI.

In a console type `node server.js` and then click on `index.html` to play!

It's required `node` for the web server and `swipl` for the Prolog code.
It's required also the module `ws` obtainable with `npm install ws`.
If the packet manager `npm` is not available on your system, install it with `sudo apt install npm` if on a Linux machine or a similar approach if on Windows or MacOS.
